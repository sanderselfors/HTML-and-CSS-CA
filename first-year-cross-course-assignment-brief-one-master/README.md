## Report

1. Summary
   We have been given a course assignment to code the wireframes we designed in Figma using HTML and CSS. The goal was to put in use what we have learned so far in the course and create a responsive website that works on both laptop and phone. This was a very exiting, but difficult assignment. I feel that I got to challenge my skills and think of different solutions and ways to execute a problem.

2. Body
   2.1. Introduction
   My goal was to make clean and easy to understand wireframes that is interactive with each other, meaning you can navigate easily between the pages and is responsive on mobile and desktop. In the design assignment I made a product and checkout page for each and every product, but in this assignment I coded it for 1 product, and linked all the other jackets to this page due to time limitations. I made a few changes on the design on the about and checkout page as I thing it looked cleaner and better.

2.2. Main section of report
The first thing I did was to make a plan for what order I would make the pages. I thought that if I started with the easiest first with fewest elements, the most advanced pages would be easier to execute as I learned new techniques. I began with the order complete page, and moved on to the contact and about page next. I started with the header and completed it since I have the same design on the header on all pages, so that I could focus on the main section of the code for the rest of the pages. I finished the html before I moved on to the css for styling.
I then moved on to the homepage. Starting from top to bottom I had to find a way to make the site responsive to work on all devices. I first put in my homepage picture and made sure it would adjust to the screen size. I then made 1 section for my product line and 2 div ÃÅs since I had two rows with items. My plan was to make them collapse when making the screen smaller, so I used flex-wrap. It worked well I think and made the site responsive. I also made sure to inspect the site and check that It would fit a minimum of 320px in width.
Moving on the product and checkout page my plan was to use the same method, only here I made 1 section and 1 div since I only had one row with items. It worked nicely on both pages.

The last thing I did was to connect all the wireframes with interactive buttons on all the pages, so that you can navigate easily between the pages. I also made a hovering effect to make the website more alive and interactive. Lastly I deployed my website on Netlify and checked it on validator.w3.org and https://wave.webaim.org/ for any issues and problems.

2.3. Conclusion
All in all i think this was a challenging, but fun assignment. You really get to challenge yourself. I feel much more confident in coding and have learned a lot from this assignment. It will come in handy when we move on to the semester project. I look forward to getting better at coding and learning new techniques!

    First I want to thank Monde Sineke for teaching me a lot of good techniques and ways to execute tasks and problems in our classes. It has given me a lot of inspiration. I also want to thank my classmates for help when I was stuck!

5.  Appendices
    I made a website from the Figma design which is interactive and responsive throughout all the pages. My goal was to make it as easy to use as possible, and to have a nice and cool design with fresh colors. I have explained the reasoning for my methods in the main section above.
